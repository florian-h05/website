## Add-on Enhancements

openHAB 5.1 brings xx new add-ons, adding support for new devices:

- [HomeKit Binding](/addons/bindings/homekit/): Allows pairing with HomeKit accessories and **imports** them into openHAB.
  Do not confuse this with the [HomeKit System Integration](/addons/integrations/homekit/) which **exports** openHAB Items to a HomeKit controller.
- [Modus.FoxInverter Binding](/addons/bindings/modbus.foxinverter/): Integrates FoxEss solar inverters and derivatives like the Solakon ONE into openHAB.

But not only were new bindings added, some existing bindings also received massive improvements:

> TBD (in format):
> - The [Amber Electric Binding](/addons/bindings/amberelectric/) adds support for energy price forecasts.
