One year has passed since our big [openHAB 4.0 release](/blog/2023-07-23-openhab-4-0-release.html), and we are thrilled to announce our first summer minor release of the openHAB 4.x series: openHAB 4.2.
openHAB 4.2 adds a number of exciting new features, including some long awaited notification enhancements, as well as a multitude of smaller improvements and bug fixes.

With that being said, we as usual want to share our highlights and some statistics that show the activity in numbers.

# Activity

As you'd expect from any new openHAB release, we have had a high activity across all our GitHub repositories.
We therefore want to share a few statistics about our three main repositories: Core, add-ons and UIs.

[openHAB Core](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-core) has received XXX pull requests in total, with XX bug fixes and XX enhancements resulting in XX,xxx lines of code added.

X new add-ons, XX bug fixes and XXX enhancements were contributed to the [openHAB add-ons repository](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-addons), which resulted in the addition of XX,xxx lines of code.

The [openHAB web UIs](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-webui) have broken their "personal" best with a whopping XXX pull requests, including XX bug fixes and XX enhancements and resulting in X,xxx lines of code added.

It is worth to mention, that [our other repositories](https://github.com/openhab) have also received numerous contributions (e.g. documentation), but listing them all would probably be too much here.
Many thanks to all our contributors for driving openHAB forward!

Again, it is time to shout out to our top code contributors per repository (having done the most commits) for this new release:

- Wouter ([@wborn](https://github.com/wborn)) for openHAB core
- Holger ([@holgerfriedrich](https://github.com/holgerfriedrich)) for openHAB core
- Jan ([@J-N-K](https://github.com/J-N-K)) for openHAB core
- Jacob ([@jlaur](https://github.com/jlaur)) for openHAB add-ons
- Holger ([@holgerfriedrich](https://github.com/holgerfriedrich)) for openHAB add-ons
- Florian ([@florian-h05](https://github.com/florian-h05)) for the openHAB Main UI
- Jimmy ([@jimtng](https://github.com/jimtng)) for the openHAB Main UI
- Laurent ([@lolodomo](https://github.com/lolodomo)) for the openHAB Basic UI

Many of our top committers are also maintainers, which means besides contributing code, they also review pull requests and participate in discussions on GitHub issues, which helps maintain our high level of quality across bindings, UIs and Core.
At present, we have 36 maintainers across all our repositories.
Huge thanks to all of them for keeping a high development pace for openHAB 4.2!

# Highlights

As you might have already noticed in the activity statistics, there was much development on openHAB - too much to list everything.
Please refer to the [**release notes**](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-distro/releases/tag/4.2.0) to check out what's new and noteworthy (e.g. breaking changes).

In the following sections, our maintainers and contributors are introducing some new features you don't want to miss!

## Notification Enhancements

@digitaldan: https://github.com/openhab/openhab-addons/issues/16934

Huge thanks to Dan Cunningham ([@digitaldan](https://github.com/digitaldan)) for doing all the work on openHAB Cloud, the Cloud Connector add-on and the iOS app!

Many thanks to our app maintainers [@weakfl](https://github.com/weakfl), Dan Cunningham ([@digitaldan](https://github.com/digitaldan)), Tim Bert ([@timbms](https://github.com/timbms)) [@mueller-ma](https://github.com/mueller-ma) and Danny Baumann ([@maniac103](https://github.com/maniac103)) for all their work on the apps!

## Core Runtime Enhancements

### Persistence Extensions

_Mark Herwege ([@mherwege](https://github.com/mherwege)), openHAB Contributor_

Persistence Extensions have allowed the different scripting languages to easily persist states and retrieve persisted states or values calculated from these persisted states for a long time.

As openHAB supports units of measure, persistence services can also return persisted values in a unit of measure.
However, the Persistence Extensions did not consider these units of measure and would return just a decimal value as the result of a calculation.
With openHAB 4.2, Persistence Extension have been enhance to also return the unit of measure.
This allows rules and scripts to simply calculate with QuantityTypes without any implicit or explicit conversion to a DecimalType, while keeping the results consistent if different units of measure are used.
Note that this change may require adapting previous rules.

With the introduction of [Time Series support](/blog/2023-12-22-openhab-4-1-release.html#time-series-support-for-forecasts-and-historical-values) in openHAB 4.1, persistence services were extended to allow storing future values and forecasts.
openHAB 4.2 extends the Persistence Extensions to allow persisting future states and retrieving future values.
All persistence retrieval methods now have _last_, _next_ and _between_ variants of the methods, whereby _last_ will use the period from a time in the past until now, _next_ will use the period from now to a future time and _between_ will use the period between two provided points in time in the past and/or future.

To allow storing multiple values to persistence in one go, Persistence Extensions methods now support working with TimeSeries instead of individual values when persisting or retrieving data.
Time Series are series of time/value pairs, and can be constructed in rules, e.g. by modifying a Time Series retrieved from another persistence service or another Item.

Also, there was no way before to retrieve the time of the last state change for an item from persistence.
The existing methods (`previousState()` or `previousState(true)`) would not give the right result if the same value had been persisted multiple times.
A new method `lastChange()` has been added to resolve this.

Scripting languages (Rules DSL, JavaScript, jRuby and Blockly) have implement full support of these new and enhanced Persistence Extensions, please refer to the individual languages' documentation for more information.

As much has changed, it is worthwhile to read the [documentation](/docs/configuration/persistence.html#persistence-extensions-in-scripts-and-rules) to update your knowledge about openHAB persistence extensions and learn everything about the new features.

## Main UI Enhancements

### Dependency & Build System Upgrades

openHAB 4.2 upgrades most of Main UI's dependencies to their latest version, including the charting engine [Apache ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org) and the date and time manipulation library [dayjs](https://day.js.org).
As Main UI is still using Vue 2, we would like to upgrade to Vue 3 in the future - by upgrading to the latest Vue 2.x version, we have taken a minor step towards Vue 3.

In addition to our runtime dependencies, we have also upgraded our build system to the latest tooling: Webpack 5 and Node.js 20.
This ensures we can always use the latest Webpack features when bundling the Main UI source code, and moves away from Node.js 16, which is now EOL.

Many thanks to Miguel √Ålvarez ([@GiviMAD](https://github.com/givimad)) for the Webpack upgrade!

### Semantic Model Templates

### Persistence Settings Menu

Persistence configuration through the UI has been [supported since openHAB 4.0](/blog/2023-07-23-openhab-4-0-release.html#persistence-configuration), but unfortunately it was hidden in the add-on settings and difficult to find.

This finally changes with openHAB 4.2 with the introduction of the new persistence settings menu:

<p align="center"><img style="max-width: 70%;" src="/uploads/2024-07-07-openhab-4-2-release/persistence-menu.png"/></p>

The new page is reachable through the settings menu and allows to configure the default persistence service, persistence policies and installation of more persistence add-ons.

Thanks to Mark Herwege ([@mherwege](https://github.com/mherwege)) for the contribution!

### Item Form Enhancements

### Setup Wizard Extensions

With the introduction of [add-on suggestions](/blog/2023-12-22-openhab-4-1-release.html#add-on-suggestions) in openHAB 4.1, we made a first, big step towards a better first-user experience.

openHAB 4.2 continues this path by extending the setup wizard with a separate step for persistence.
In this step, suggested persistence add-ons are displayed together with a short explanation for the suggestion.
The user can then decide if he wants to install the suggested persistence add-ons or not, and install more add-ons in the next step:

<div align="center" class="row">
  <img style="max-width: 35%;" src="/uploads/2024-07-07-openhab-4-2-release/setup-wizard-persistence.png"/>
  <img style="max-width: 35%;" src="/uploads/2024-07-07-openhab-4-2-release/setup-wizard-addons.png"/>
</div>

Many thanks to Mark Herwege ([@mherwege](https://github.com/mherwege)), who already worked on the add-on suggestions in openHAB 4.1, for this enhancement!

### `oh-context` Component

### Health UI

Ever heard of orphaned links before? Orphaned links are channel links, where either the Item or the channel (or possibly even both) are missing.

As you can imagine, orphaned links can and should be removed.
The new health UI allows to easily check if there are orphaned links and take care of them:

<p align="center"><img style="max-width: 70%;" src="/uploads/2024-07-07-openhab-4-2-release/health-menu.png"/></p>
<p align="center"><img style="max-width: 70%;" src="/uploads/2024-07-07-openhab-4-2-release/health-orphan-links.png"/></p>

The health UI is not only meant to display orphaned links, but also to provide a central place for health checks and maintenance tasks.
So stay tuned what gets added in the future!

Many thanks to Arne Seime ([@seime](https://github.com/seime)) for this addition!
