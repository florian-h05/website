<!-- Intro Text -->

You can find the full list of new add-ons, enhancements and fixes in our [**official release notes**](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-distro/releases/tag/4.0.0).

With that being said, we again want to share some statistics that show the progress in numbers.

# Activity

<!-- Share some stats about PRs, LOC etc. like in https://www.openhab.org/blog/2022-06-26-openhab-3-3-release.html#activity -->
<!-- Thank major contributors like in https://www.openhab.org/blog/2022-12-19-openhab-3-4-release.html -->

# Highlights

As this is a major release, there are some major (breaking) changes like the switch to Java 17, but there is no single big thing or visible change like the introduction of MainUI in openHAB 3 to learn about.
Instead, we have quite a large number of new features and enhancements and we hope everyone finds something that matters to him.

Therefore, please have a look at the release notes and check out the following highlights of our amazing new release.
